# geo-quizzer
The purpose is to improve knowledge of geography.

In order to start this up, download the backend folder, data folder, and index.html. Put these in a single folder.
open up powershell (or some other terminal) and type cd "insert address of the backend folder", and then press enter. After that, type "python app.py" then press enter. This starts up a server on which you can run the application. You should then be able to access the application in your browser at http://localhost:8001/.

I'm sure there is a more graceful way to do this; but I haven't found it!
